# **Deriving Differential and Difference Equations Using Reciprocal Inversion Properties**

## **Abstract**
This paper explores the derivation of differential and difference equations using the reciprocal inversion property, both in its continuous and discrete forms. Starting with the fundamental relationship between a function and its inverse, this approach systematically derives governing equations for continuous and discrete systems. The results demonstrate how the reciprocal property serves as a powerful tool for bridging closed forms and equations of change.

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Motivation**
Differential and difference equations are fundamental to modeling natural and mathematical phenomena. Deriving these equations from known closed forms, or vice versa, is a key task in applied mathematics and computational science.

### **1.2 Reciprocal Inversion Property**
The reciprocal inversion property provides a direct relationship between a function and its inverse, expressed as:

#### **Continuous Form**
$$
f'(x) \cdot \left( f^{-1} \right)'(f(x)) = 1.
$$

#### **Discrete Form**
$$
\left( f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}) \right) \cdot \left( f^{-1}(f(x_n)) - f^{-1}(f(x_{n-1})) \right) = 1.
$$

This paper demonstrates how these properties can be used to derive differential and difference equations, offering a unified approach to understanding change in both continuous and discrete systems.

## **2. Reciprocal Inversion Properties**

### **2.1 Derivation of the Continuous Property**
The continuous reciprocal inversion property arises naturally from the chain rule. If $y = f(x)$, then $x = f^{-1}(y)$. Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot \frac{dx}{dy} = 1.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
f'(x) \cdot \left( f^{-1} \right)'(f(x)) = 1.
$$

### **2.2 Derivation of the Discrete Property**
For the discrete case, consider forward differences:

$$
\Delta f = f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}), \quad \Delta f^{-1} = f^{-1}(f(x_n)) - f^{-1}(f(x_{n-1})).
$$

The discrete reciprocal property then states:

$$
\Delta f \cdot \Delta f^{-1} = 1,
$$

or equivalently:

$$
\left( f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}) \right) \cdot \left( f^{-1}(f(x_n)) - f^{-1}(f(x_{n-1})) \right) = 1.
$$

## **3. Deriving Differential Equations**

### **3.1 From Closed Form to Differential Equation**
#### **Example 1: $f(x) = e^{3x}$**
1. Closed form: $f(x) = e^{3x}$.
2. Inverse: $f^{-1}(y) = \frac{\ln(y)}{3}$.
3. Reciprocal property:

$$
f'(x) \cdot \left( f^{-1} \right)'(f(x)) = 1.
$$

4. Substituting derivatives:

$$
f'(x) = 3e^{3x}, \quad \left( f^{-1} \right)'(y) = \frac{1}{3y}.
$$

5. Result:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 3y.
$$

#### **Example 2: $f(x) = 3x^2$**
1. Closed form: $f(x) = 3x^2$.
2. Inverse: $f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{\frac{y}{3}}$.
3. Reciprocal property:

$$
f'(x) \cdot \left( f^{-1} \right)'(f(x)) = 1.
$$

4. Substituting derivatives:

$$
f'(x) = 6x, \quad \left( f^{-1} \right)'(y) = \frac{1}{6\sqrt{\frac{y}{3}}}.
$$

5. Result:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x.
$$

$$

4. Substitute inverse: $f^{-1}(y) = \frac{\ln(y)}{3}$.
5. Solve for $f(x_n)$:

$$
f(x_n) = e^3 \cdot f(x_{n-1}).
$$

#### **Example 2: $f(x) = 3x^2$**
1. Closed form: $f(x) = 3x^2$.

$$
\left( f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}) \right) \cdot \left( f^{-1}(f(x_n)) - f^{-1}(f(x_{n-1})) \right) = 1.
$$

4. Substitute inverse: $f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{\frac{y}{3}}$.
5. Solve for $f(x_n)$:

$$
f(x_n) = 3 \left( \sqrt{\frac{f(x_{n-1})}{3}} + 1 \right)^2.
$$
